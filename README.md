# Food Sensitivity and Symptom Tracker

# Overview
This iOS application helps users track symptoms in relation to their food intake. The goal is to assist users in identifying potential food sensitivities or intolerance, whether they are caused by specific foods or food additives. The app will allow users to log the time and type of food consumed, as well as the symptoms experienced, to help them identify patterns or correlations over time.

## Our Purpose  
The **Food Symptom Tracker** was created to assist individuals in better understanding how their diet impacts their health. Our goal is to provide a tool that simplifies tracking food intake and related symptoms, enabling users to identify patterns and potential sensitivities more easily. We were motivated to build this app because of the growing demand for personalized health solutions and the lack of intuitive tools for managing food-related sensitivities.

Some of our primary goals are:
 - Empower users to make informed decisions about their diets
 - Use modern technologies to offer insights about health  
 - Explore how software can address real-world health challenges in a user-friendly way
 - Enable users to keep track of and analyze their personal health using available tools

# Key Features:
- **Food & Symptom Tracking**: Users can log the foods they eat and the symptoms they experience, along with timestamps for both.
- **Correlation Analysis**: The app will help users identify if thereâ€™s a potential link between the time they consumed a certain food and when they experienced a symptom.
- **FatSecret Platform API Integration**: Users will be able to search and log foods from the FatSecret API database.
- **User Authentication**: A log-in page will allow users to create an account and save their data securely.
- **Homepage**: A user-friendly homepage will provide an overview of their recent food entries and symptoms.

# Usage
    1. **Sign Up/Login**: Create an account or log in.
    2. **Review Helpful Articles**: Explore new recipes, wellness hacks, and more on the homepage.
    3. **Add Food Entries**: Search for food using the FatSecret API to quickly log foods.
    4. **Log Symptoms**: Enter any symptoms you experience and the time they occurred.
    5. **Analyze Correlations**: View potential correlations between your food intake and symptoms based on the times logged.
